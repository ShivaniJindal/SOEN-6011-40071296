	DEBUGGER\\
	Advantages and Disadvantages.

\newline
The Eclipse Platform is designed for building (IDEs) integrated development environments, and arbitrary tools. The Eclipse Platform UI is built around a workbench that includes menu and tool bar actions for running and debugging arbitrary programs, and provides a generic debug perspective better suited to that task. \\
ADVANTAGES:-
\begin{itemize} [noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
	\item When a Java program is launched in debug mode, a debug view shows the processes, threads, and stack frames.
	\item During single stepping, the debugger instructs the editor which source
	code line to highlight. Debug-specific views show the list of breakpoints, the values of variables, and the fields of objects. Breakpoints are represented by a special type of marker.
	\item It don't require several recompiles for what might be a small problem and
	often allow debugger-time altering of the variables, which might be handy as well.
\end{itemize}
	DISADVANTAGES:-
	\begin{itemize} [noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
\item	Sometimes Eclipse can get into a bad state and one have to clear the caches and restart or go through elaborate build-clean-build processes to fix it.
\item	Eclipse run very slowly.
\end{itemize}

 	CHECKSTYLE\\
 	Advantages and Disadvantages.
 \end{minipage}
 \newline
 \newline
 Checkstyle is a development tool to help programmers write Java code that adheres to a coding standard. It automates the process of checking Java code to spare humans of this boring (but important) task. This makes it ideal for projects that want to enforce a coding standard. \\
 \newline
 ADVANTAGES:-
 \begin{itemize} [noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
 	\item Check many aspects of your source code such as it can find class design problems, method design problems. 
 	\item It has the ability to check code layout and formatting issues.
 	\item Checks that the parts of a class or interface declaration appear in the order suggested by the Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language.
 	 \end{itemize}

 DISADVANTAGES:-
 \begin{itemize} [noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
 	\item Java code should be written with ASCII characters only, no UTF-8 support.
 	\item To get valid violations, code have to be compilable, in other case you can get not easy to understand parse errors.
 	\item You cannot determine the full inheritance hierarchy of type.
 	\item You cannot see the content of other files. All files are processed one by one.
 \end{itemize}
