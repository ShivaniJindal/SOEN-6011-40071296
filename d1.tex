The gamma function is a continuous extension to the factorial function, which is only defined for the complex numbers and non-negative integers. The gamma function is defined as:

\end{figure} 
\newline
If p>0, then, integration by parts yields the formula Γ(p+1)=pΓ(p)Γ(p+1)=pΓ(p). Using this formula, one can extend the domain of definition inductively by setting first Γ(p)=Γ(p+1)pΓ(p)=Γ(p+1)p for −1<p<0−1<p<0.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The gamma function does not satisfy any algebraic differential equation.
	\item It is applicable in the fields of probability and statistics, as well as combinatorics.
\item The gamma function  is an analytical function of, which is defined over the whole complex ‐plane with the exception of countably many points.
\item The function has an infinite set of singular points, which are the simple poles with residues. 
\item The function  does not have branch points and branch cuts.
\item The function  does not have periodicity.
\item The function  has mirror symmetry.
\item The gamma function satisfies the recursive property:

\newpage
The methods of Stirling and Lanczos share the common strategy of terminating an infinite series and estimating the error which results. Also in common among these two methods, is a free parameter which controls the accuracy of the approximation.
Stirling’s asymptotic series forms the basis for most computational algorithms for the gamma function and much has been written on its implementation. An example on the use of Stirling’s series is given with a short discussion of error bounds.
Although not quite as accurate as Lanczos’ method using the same number of terms of the series and difficult to compute.\\
The conclusion is that each method has its merits and shortcomings, and the question of which is best has no clear answer. For a uniformly bounded relative error, Lanczos’ method seems most efficient, while Stirling’s series yields very accurate results for z of large modulus due to its error term which decreases rapidly with increasing |z|. 
\newline
Out of the two implementation algorithms for the Gamma function, i will choose Lanczo's approximation method over Striling's approximation. Although Striling is easy to compute but still lacks accuracy where as Lanczo is more accurate, precise, efficient and can deal with relative error.
